  ## Skills

  #### + Analytical Thinker

  At Yale, I was solely responsible for managing a $225k budget for production and musical artists to host a concert for 10,000 students (release video for concert [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17iBpTIbjF8)). While at Citigroup, I analysed market and convertible bond data to pitch trade ideas to high-value clients on a weekly basis, after careful risk analysis.

  #### + Fast Learner

  Even though I lacked a background or prior knowledge in Finance, Citigroup offered me a full-time job after I demonstrated I could pick-up technical financial concepts in a short amount of time. During my time at Intercom, I researched and built out processes for an Outbound Sales Motion from scratch which I had previous experience doing. Similarly, at Makers, I independently taught myself PyGame even though it wasn't in the syllabus, and built a functioning game of Pong within 2 days.

  #### + Strong Interpersonal Skills and Team-Player

  - Born in England but grew up in America -- learnt how to manage different types of people
  - While at Citigroup, I spoke to clients in very stressful situations, and learnt how to take the right tone
  - Mentored a prison inmate
  - This helped me in pairing sessions at Makers, and will help me continue to be a good team-mate

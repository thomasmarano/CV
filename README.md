  ## Interests

  #### + Foreign Affairs and International Politics

  In recent times, the dramatic political upheaval across the world has sent me searching for answers. Whether I'm reading about Xi Jinping's consolidation of power in China or the age-old Sunni-Shia power struggle in the Middle East, I draw parallels from history and across borders to make better sense of the world around me today.  

  #### + Music and Concerts

  Aside from attending numerous concerts and music festivals, I have also dabbled in the production side of things. At Yale, I led a 30-person team, managed a budget of $225k and all logistical aspects related to hosting a concert for 10,000 students. Artists included [Jessie J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_J). Release video for the concert can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17iBpTIbjF8).

  #### + Counselling and Mentoring

  My itch to solve problems extends throughout my personal life. When those around me tell me about personal problems, much like with programming, I do my best to isolate the problem, reframe it, and then determine incremental steps to find a solution. Whether the counterpart is a friend, a colleague, or a youth inmate in prison, I don't feel satisfied until I have positively contributed in some way.

  ## About Me

  Since graduating from Yale University, I have worked in two business roles at Citigroup and Intercom. I have now turned all my energy to the wonderful world of coding and building things.

  I am an enthusiastic and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a London-based role where I can further my programming skills, while also gaining exposure to product management and business strategy. I recently completed a 16-week software development bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), and am looking for a company that, above all, prizes learning and mentorship.

  ## Skills

  #### + Fast Learner

  Even though I lacked a background or prior knowledge in Finance, Citigroup offered me a full-time job after I demonstrated I could pick-up technical financial concepts in a short amount of time. During my time at Intercom, I researched and built out processes for an *outbound sales motion* from scratch despite no previous experience. Similarly at Makers, I independently taught myself PyGame, absent from the syllabus, and built a functioning game of Pong within 2 days.

  #### + Analytical Thinker

  While at Citigroup, I analysed market and convertible bond data to pitch trade ideas to clients on a weekly basis, after careful risk analysis. Additionally, at Yale, I was solely responsible for analysing and allocating a $225k budget for production and musical artists to host a concert for 10,000 students with artists like Jessie J (release video for concert [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17iBpTIbjF8)).

  #### + Strong Interpersonal Skills

  I was born in England to American parents so quickly learned to find common ground with diverse people. Through speaking to frustrated clients at Citigroup or youth inmates in the US penitentiary system, I've nurtured this ability to build genuine, trusting relationships with people very different from me. This helped me greatly during our pairing sessions at Makers, not to mention, as a teammate in both my previous roles.
